/home/chiar/anaconda3/envs/mldl/lib/python3.7/site-packages/stable_baselines3/ppo/ppo.py:146: UserWarning: You have specified a mini-batch size of 160, but because the `RolloutBuffer` is of size `n_steps * n_envs = 1024`, after every 6 untruncated mini-batches, there will be a truncated mini-batch of size 64
We recommend using a `batch_size` that is a factor of `n_steps * n_envs`.
Info: (n_steps=1024 and n_envs=1)
